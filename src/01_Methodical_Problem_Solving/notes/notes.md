# Notes

## Pre-Work

- First: You have to understand the problem.

  - You should be able to point out these principal parts of the problem:
    - What is the unknown?
    - What are the data?
    - What is the condition?
  - Separate the various parts of the condition.
  - Is the condition sufficient to determine the unknown?
  - Start from the statement of the problem
  - Visualize the problem as a whole as clearly as you can. Do not concern
    yourself with details for the moment.
  - The unknown, the data, and the conditions are the principal parts of a
    "problem to find."

- Second: Devise a plan. Find the connection between the data and the unknown. You should
  eventually obtain a plan of the solution.

  - Have you seen it before?
  - Do you know a related problem?
  - Look at the unknown. Try to think of a familiar problem having the same or a
    similar unknown.
  - If you cannot solve the proposed problem, try to solve a related problem
    first.
  - Could you restate the problem? Go back to definitions.
  - Did you use all of the data?
  - Did you use the whole condition?
  - Have you taken into account all essential notions involved in the problem?
  - You should see sufficiently far ahead before beginning on the solution.
  - Isolate the principal parts of your problem.
  - The hypothesis and the conclusion are the principal parts of a "problem to
    prove"

- Third: Carry out the plan of the solution, check each step.

  - Can you see clearly that each step is correct?
  - Can you prove that it is correct?

- Fourth: Check the result.

  - Can you check the argument?
  - Can you derive the result differently?
  - Can you use the result, or the method, for some other problem?
